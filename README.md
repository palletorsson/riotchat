Occupy was right: we need to get rid of super managers holding the world down. Since revolutions constantly fail in the streets, we must simultaneously continue to riot the Internet. Here is Riot Chat - a Twitter-IRC-game remix. Riot Chat is an homage to kopimi (copyme), a symbol showing that you want to be copied, and a sandbox for an anti-surveillance communicatio protocol.
